* Firstly, we downloaded the dataset from Kaggle. Subsequently, using Python, we initiated a preprocessing phase to ensure data quality. To enrich the dataset, a column with __album cover URLs__ was incorporated by connecting to the __Spotify for Developer API__, also through Python. 

* On the design front, we crafted a template in PowerPoint, experimenting with hues, transparencies, and lighting effects. This template was later imported into Power BI as the canvas background. 

* Finally, we create the necessary DAX measures in Power BI to achieve the desired KPIs. The most interesting thing for me, was the utilization of __Deneb__ to achieve the Unit Chart for "Energy" and the central __Heatmap__, drawing inspiration from GitHub.
